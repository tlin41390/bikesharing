## Overview

    The Purpose of the analysis is to be able to come up with different data visuals to represent the overall census of those who take citibike in New York City. There are many ways to represent the data model in Tableau, whether that would be a map that represents the most popular starting point, the heatmap that shows frequency of bikes used, or even different line charts and pie charts that show the gender frequency of the bike sharing company. Using Tableau and the visualizations provides a tool that grants a deep insight on how a business may run.

**Data Models

![citMap](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/citydata.png)

Here is a visual on the map of New York City and the spots where bikers are more likely to start. The data reveals that lower Manhattan is really popular with alot of spots in the area being dark blue for frequency, and more so torwards the Hudson River.

![frequencymap](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/frequencyheatmap.png)

The Frequency Map shows that weedays are generally more busy with activity in 7-8 am and activity coming from 5-6 pm, probably from people that use citibike to travel to their respective jobs and back.

![gender heat map](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/heatmapgender.png)

The gender frequency map is simialiar to the frequency map, this time it takes into account the gender. Here we can see that males are more likely to ride.

![pie chart](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/pie.png)

This is the pie chart that shows the proportion of males, females, and other genders riding with citibike. The data clearly shows that males are more likely to ride with citibike.

![line chart](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/line.png)

This visualization shows the number of rides and how long they usually take. Usually bike rides last about an hour or so as it dramatically tapers off after an hour.

![gender line chart](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/genderline.png)

This visualization, simialiar to line chart, takes into account the gender of the bikers. The data shows that there is no significant difference between the races and how long, or how many bikes are rode.

![frequency usertype](https://github.com/tlin41390/bikesharing/blob/main/Charts/usertypes.png)

This visualization shows the different user types subscriber, and customer. The data shows that subscribers generally use the service the most specifically the male subscribers.
